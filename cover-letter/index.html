	Dear Recruitment team,
</p>

<p>
	My name is Alejandro Catalán, this year I am getting my degree in Computer Science at University Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona, I only have to finish my Final Project. This is the reason why I am sending this e-mail to you, because I am very interested in working for a game developer company. I would like to work in the game industry so I need an opportunity to gain experience and improve my skills.
</p>

<p>
	Although I have not much professional experience yet in the game industry, I am very focused on work out a career as a game developer, and my main goal is to grew up as professional in this field. I've been programming C++ and other languages for over 7 years, I have no problem learning new languages if necessary. During the degree I have been gaining knowledge of mathematics, physics, software design patterns, computational geometry, 3D/2D programming, texturing, engineering interaction, etc. Nowadays in my spare time I'm practicing and developing with Unity3D some projects that are interesting to me, and learning WebGL and developing an engine for my Final Project.

<p>
	Apart from the expertise mentioned, I learn fast and can deal with new frameworks. I'm good at working both in team and individually. Also you can read a brief explanation and watch videos of some projects on my website: <a href="" style="text-decoration:none;">http://www.madowen.es/</a> One of my proudest projects in the degree that you can find on my website, was a game engine programmed by myself. Although it is a bit limited in gameplay, it was developed using Composite Pattern and has implemented a small particle system, collisions, physics and some more features.
</p>

<p>
	You can find my resume on my website: <a href="/curriculum/" style="text-decoration:none;">http://www.madowen.es/curriculum</a>
</p>

<p>
	Do not hesitate to contact me by mail if any more information is required. Thank you in advance for your time.
</p>

<p>
	Sincerely.
</p>

<p>
	Alejandro Catalán
